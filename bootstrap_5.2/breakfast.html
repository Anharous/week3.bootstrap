            <p><h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3></p>
            <p><h3>How to make Paratha Recipe</h3></p>
            <li> In a large mixing bowl add 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 teaspoon of oil or ghee, ½ teaspoon of salt.Add ½ cup water in portions as you go on mixing and kneading the dough. Keep in mind not to add all of the water at once.making paratha dough in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix and knead into a smooth, soft dough. Continue to add a bit more water a splash at a time if required while kneading.Cover with a kitchen towel and set the dough aside to rest for 30 minutes.kneadied paratha dough Triangle Folded Method</li>
            <li>Pinch a medium-sized ball from the dough. Dust with flour and flatten on a clean surface that’s also dusted with a bit of flour.paratha dough ball on a board.</li>
            <li>Use a rolling pin to roll the paratha dough into a circle that’s about 4 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> use the back of a spoon to spread some ghee (or oil) to coat the surface of the dough circle.</li>
            <li>Fold the dough circle in half with the spoon.</li>
            <li>Now spread some more ghee on this folded half of dough.</li>
            <li> sideways to create a triangle shape, like in the photo below.</li>
            <li> some flour on the folded triangle.</li>
            <li>Roll the folded triangle back into a round disc of dough or in a triangular shape.</li>
            <li>As you roll you can add some flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking. The dough should be rolled into a circle that’s about 6 to 7 inches in diameter.</li>
            <p><h5>Folded Method</h5></p>
            <p><h5>method does not change the taste of the paratha, but does create a more square-shaped flatbread.</h5></p>
            <li>To make a square version of paratha, first flatten a medium-sized ball of dough on a lightly dusted board. Roll out to form a circle of about 4 to 5 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon to evenly spread some ghee or oil on the rolled dough.</li>
            <li>Bring one side of the rolled dough towards the center and press lightly. Spread more ghee on the folded part.</li>
            <li>Fold the opposite side of the rolled dough on top of the folded part. Press lightly, and again spread the ghee on this second folded part.</li>
            <li>Next, fold the right side of the paratha dough to bring it towards the center. Spread some ghee on this fold, too.</li>
            <li> Lastly, fold the left side on top of the right fold. You should have a nice little bundle of dough, like in the photo below.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some flour on the folded paratha.</li>
            <li> Begin to roll. Add some more flour if needed while rolling so that the dough doesn’t stick.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into a square shape.</li>
            <p><h5>Cook Plain Paratha</h5></p>
            <p><h5>Once you’ve rolled out all of the paratha dough discs or square, heat a tawa (skillet) over medium heat on the stovetop. Working one at a time, place one of the paratha onto the tawa.To test the hotness of the skillet, sprinkle a few pinches of flour in the center. if it browns in a few seconds, the tawa is hot enough to begin with the paratha roasting.With a kitchen napkin, wipe off these browned flour particles from the skillet before you begin roasting paratha.place paratha on tava</h5></p>
            <li>The paratha will begin to puff up and bubble from the heat. Roast paratha on a medium to high heat and do regulate the heat as needed.</li>
            <p><h5>A thin skillet or pan will need medium heat and a heavy skillet or pan will need medium-high to high heat.frying paratha on skillet</h5></p>
            <li> When the bottom of the paratha is about ¼ of the way browned (you will see the paratha having some air pockets), flip it over with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Spread on some ghee.</li>
            <li>Flip again when the second side is about ½ way cooked. You will see brown spots now.</li>
            <li>Now spread ghee on this side.</li>
            <li>applying ghee on second side of paratha</li>
            <li>Flip again a couple of times until you see more brown spots and the paratha is cooked evenly.</li>
            <p><h5>Transfer to a holding plate or a casserole container or a roti basket/box, and repeat the process to cook all of the flatbreads.flip and roast paratha on tawa</h5></p>
            <li>Serve the plain paratha right away while hot or store in a roti basket until ready to enjoy.</li>
            <li>Paratha can be served with any Indian mains like lentils, curries, gravies and even dry sautéed or steamed vegetable dishes. You can also enjoy them with mango pickle or lemon pickle.</li>

        <center><img src="../assets/idli.jpg" alt="idli pic" width="500"></center>
        <center><p><h3>-----Ingredients-----</h3></p></center>
        <center><ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cup basmati rice---1 1/2 cup urad dal</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon fenugreek seeds---salt as required</li>
            <li>5 tablespoon sesame oil---water as required</li>
        </ul></center>
        <center><p><h3>----------Instructions---------</h3></p></center>
        <p><h5>Step 1</h5> Soak the rice & dal and grind into a paste & combine To prepare this popular South Indian recipe, wash rice and urad dal separately until the water runs clean and add fenugreek seeds to the rice. Soak it in water for 4-6 hours. Soak the urad dal too for the same amount of time. Drain all the water from the urad dal and grind it to a fine paste. Add water accordingly. Grind the rice to a coarse paste (add water as needed) and then mix both the pastes together in a large bowl and whisk them well. Make sure that the consistency is thick.</p>
        <p><h5>Step 2</h5> Let the batter ferment, then add salt Now, the idli batter needs to be well-fermented. This step is very important to get soft and fluffy idlis. Keep the batter in a warm place to ferment. Once the batter has risen, add salt to it and whisk to mix it well.</p>
        <p><h5>Step 3</h5> Transfer the idli batter in the idli stand Grease the idli stand with oil and take a ladleful of batter and fill the idli mould. Add ½ cup of water in the idli steamer and let it boil. Put the idli stand inside and close the lid. Let the steam build for 8-10 minutes before switching off the gas.</p>
        <p><h5>Step 4</h5> Wait for the utensil to cool a bit before scooping the idlis out</p>
        <p><h5>step 5</h5> If you are using a cooker, use it without a vent and steam it for 10 minutes and then switch the gas off. In both cases, wait till the steam is released before you take the idli stand out. Wait for another 5 minutes and then use a sharp knife to scoop the idlis out. Serve warm with coconut chutney and sambhar.</p>
        
        <center><p><h3>-----Tips-----</h3></p></center>
        <ul>
           <li>If you have a stone mortar and pestle, grind your idli paste in it for a nice flavour.</li>
           <li>Use urad dal harvested in the same year in the recipe for best taste. New urad would be white without any tints of yellow.</li>
           <li> Do not used an iodised salt in this recipe as it would not let the batter ferment properly.</li>
        </ul>

        <center><img src="../assets/chanamasala.jpg" alt="chana masala pic" width="500"></center>
        <ol>
            <center><p><h3>-----Ingredients-----</h3></p></center>
            <li>3 Tbsp grape seed oil (or sub coconut oil)</li>
            <li>1 medium white or yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp sea salt (divided // plus more to taste)</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced (6 cloves yield ~3 Tbsp)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>2-3 fresh green chilies, sliced with seeds (I used serrano peppers // reduce amount if you prefer less heat)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 28-ounce can pureed or finely diced tomatoes (if unsalted, you’ll add more salt to the dish)</li>
            <li>2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, slightly drained</li>
            <li>1 tsp garam masala* (see instructions for DIY blend)</li>
            <li>2-3 tsp coconut sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice (plus more to taste)</li>
        </ol>
        <center><P><h3>----------instructions----------</h3></P></center>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, cumin, and one-third of the salt (1/4 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).</li>
            <li>Add garlic, ginger, cilantro, and green chilies to a mortar and pestle and grind into a rough paste (or use a small food processor to pulse into a paste. Alternatively, just finely mince.) Then, add to the pan with the onions.</li>
            <li>Next add ground coriander, chili powder, and turmeric and stir to coat. Add a little more oil at this point if the pan is looking dry.</li>
            <li>Next add pureed tomatoes and chickpeas and remaining salt (1/2 tsp as original recipe is written). If the mixture looks a little too thick, add up to 1 cup (240 ml) water (I added ~1/2 cup (120 ml) // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). You’re looking for a semi-thick soup consistency at this point, as it will cook down into more of a stew.</li>
            <li>heat to medium high until it reaches a rolling simmer, then reduce heat to low or medium-low and maintain a simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes, or until thick and stew-like. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, if you don’t have garam masala seasoning, make your own by adding (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) 2 small dried red chilies, 1 tsp black peppercorns (or 1/2 tsp ground black pepper), 1 tsp cumin seeds (or 1/2 tsp ground cumin), 1 tsp cardamom pods (or 1/2 tsp ground cardamom), 1/2 tsp cloves (or 1/4 tsp ground cloves), and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind/mix into a powder. Set aside.</li>
            <li>When the chana masala is thickened and bubbly, taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, chili powder for heat, or a bit of coconut sugar for sweetness and to offset the heat of the chilies.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and add lemon juice and garam masala. Stir to mix, then let cool slightly before serving. Fresh cilantro and lemon juice make an excellent garnish. Chana masala can be enjoyed as a stew on its own, or it can be delicious with white or brown rice (see my favorite method here), or cauliflower rice. Lastly, my favorite is over roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli (see notes for instructions).</li>
            <li>Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month.</li>
