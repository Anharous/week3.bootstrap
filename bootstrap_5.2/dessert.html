        <center><img src="../assets/laddoo.jpg" alt="laddoo pic" width="500"></center>
        <center><p><h3>-----Ingredients-----</h3></p></center>
        <ul>
            <li>•Gram Flour – 2 1/2 cups</li>
            <li>• Sugar –1 1/3 cups</li>
            <li>• Milk – 1/4 cup</li>
            <li>• Orange food colour as required</li>
            <li>• Freedom Sunflower Oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>• Green cardamom seeds – 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>• Almonds blanched – 10</li>
            <li>• Cashews blanched – 10</li>
        </ul>
        <center><p><h3>---------Method----------</h3></p></center>
        <ol>
            <li>To begin with, cook sugar with three cups of water to make a syrup of one thread consistency</li>
            <li>To it, add milk and when the scum rises to the top, put it aside</li>
            <li>Now add the food color as desired and keep the syrup aside</li>
            <li>Make a thin batter of Besan with three cups of water (pouring consistency) and add food color to it as well, as desired</li>
            <li>In a fryer, heat sufficient oil for deep frying. Hold a perforated spoon over the hot oil, pour a little batter over it and quickly press the batter through it into the fryer to make Boondi’s. Fry for about two to three minutes</li>
            <li>Now remove the Boondi’s using a slotted spoon, drain the oil thoroughly and dunk into the syrup. When the Boondi’s have absorbed all the syrup, add cardamom seeds and mix gently without mashing the Boondi’s</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into twenty-five portions and shape each into a Laddoo. Garnish with cashews and almonds, cool and serve!</li>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup Full Fat Milk Powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>a pinch Baking Soda</li>
            <li>a pinch Salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp Ghee (un melted)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Yogurt or Curd</li>
            <li>1 tsp Milk</li>
            <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
            <li>1&1/4 cup Water</li>
            <li>a pinch Saffron</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Cardamom Powder</li>
            <li>(I used oil) Oil or Ghee for Deep Frying</li>
        </ul><br>
        <center><p><h3>----------Instructions----------</h3></p></center>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix milk powder, all-purpose flour, salt and baking soda in a wide bowl, mix well until combined. Then add ghee and mix well with hand.</li>
            <li>Further, add 2 tbsp of yogurt and mix it gently. Don't over mix the dough. So, just mix it and cover the dough with the bowl and keep it aside for 10 minutes while you make the syrup.</li>
            <li>Take the sugar and water in a saucepan, bring it to boil, simmer it for 5 to 8 mins, till it gets little sticky. Then add saffron and cardamom powder and mix it well. Remove the pan from the heat, keep it aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a deep kadai or a small pan over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Add a tsp of milk to the dough and mix gently. Meanwhile, grease your hand with ghee, divide the jamun mixture into 10 portions and shape them into marble sized balls without any crack.</li>
            <li>(If any crack appears, add 1 or 2 drops of milk on the surface of the ball, and roll it gently.) Now the oil is ready to fry. Slowly drop the balls one by one and fry them till they become light dark golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove them from the oil and add these fried jamuns in the sugar syrup. The syrup has to be little hot and not boiling hot otherwise the jamuns may crack. If the syrup is not hot, then the jamuns will take more time to absorb the syrup.</li>
            <li>Keep the jamuns in the syrup for at least 2 to 3 hours or until the jamuns are doubled in their size by absorbing the sugar syrup. Now tasty gulab jamuns are ready to serve!</li>

        <center><p><h3>----------Instructions----------</h3></p></center>
        <ol>
            <li>Start things off by making the pudding. This only takes a couple of minutes and then let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>During the five minutes of setting time, I take my pretzels and crush them and slice the banana to add to the banana pudding bowl.</li>
            <li>While you could probably make this dessert in a 9 x 13 dish, I love making these in singles serving glasses. It takes just a little extra time, but I love the way they look when finished.</li>
            <li>Once you have the pudding set, I take the glasses and layer the ingredients. You can do these in any order, but I like to start with the chocolate first. Add a layer of pretzels, and then add the banana pudding with bananas. I have been able to make 6 individual sized cups with just two packages of pudding.</li>
            <li>Once you have these layers done, set the desserts in the fridge or a cool place until you are ready to serve them. This also allows more time for the pudding to set just right.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to serve, add the whipped cream, sprinkle with the powdered chocolate and top it all off with a cherry.</li>
